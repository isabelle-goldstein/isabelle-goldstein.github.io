To add new sections to the main page, follow the current examples in index.html. 
  In index.html, you'll need to add an area in the nav bar section and add an area in the main body, above the footer.
  You'll need to add a SectionName.md file to the contents directory with the section material.
  In static/js/scripts.js, you will also need to add the section identifier 
(.md file name, but idk if it needs to be the same as the ref tag in index.html) to the following line:

const section_names = ['home', 'publications', 'artsection']
